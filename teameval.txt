		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Krish Mehta

 
B: Suraj Sathya Prakash

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	         10         10
coding 	  	  	           25         30
writeup 	  	  	         5          5 
planning (alone) 	  	  	 10         10
total (including meetings) 50         55	 


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
  Suraj implemented the partial CUTLASS implementation. Krish handled the 2D tiling analysis. We then merged our methodologies to finalize the implementation.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
  We did manage to complete the assignment on the due date
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
  We had good discussions, during which we went through the reference codebase and understood the intricracies of the methodology implemented
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
  We learned that matrix multiplication on GPU has a massive speedup compared to pa1. The roofline model also gave us a good picture to estimate how our kernels should be written
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
  We are happy with the way we worked and we believe that it was a fruitful process.
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
  It was a great exposure to CUDA. We thoroughly enjoyed the process.
